                    <p align="left">
                        Hi - my name is <b>Torsten Bergmann</b>.<br><br>I'm a Father, professional IT Architect and Coder, (Software) Engineer, Advisor, 
                        Hitchhiker and Geek - all in one person. My internet nickname since many years is <b>astares</b> - this is why you ended up here - 
                        on my domain with the same name. Overall I have accumulated 30 years of experience in IT - being fortunate that I earn a 
                        living doing what I love with topics that interest me by heart.<br><br>
                    
                        I have a degree in computer science from the Technical University of Ilmenau with a focus on software engineering and telematics. 
                        My thesis researched into component-oriented software development (CORBA, COM/COM+ EJB, ...) and modular systems. I am a big fan 
                        and supporter of the OOP approach, dynamic languages ​​and metadata-driven software technology, model driven development but also RAD tools.<br><br>

                        In addition to my professional career as a software developer, consultant, project manager, software architect and later also IT manager 
                        I had responsibility in IT operations and IT security. I worked primarily in finance and insurance industry, but also logistics, transport and other.<br><br>

                        Being the lead on several business relevant applications I shaped software in close contact to users and partners according to the 
                        business needs. With strong internal teams and external support it was also possible to work on migrations for critical legacy systems 
                        and move them to more modern technology stacks while keeping these systems fully operated for the end users.
                        Part of my work was also to guide and steer such teams and introduce them to proper government procedures in regulated environments 
                        and standardized processes like release and config management.<br><br>

                        I'm used to Windows OS (down to the API level) but also use many Linux derivates like Ubuntu and elementaryOS as well as iOS on Apple. 
                        Historically I even worked on platforms like OS/2 and Solaris Unix machinery. Over the years I learned many programming languages: Basic, Pascal/Delphi,
                        Module, Haskell/Gofer, C/C++, Java, Self, JavaScript and many others. But none of them fascinated me like Smalltalk - the mother of all Object Oriented 
                        Programming languages.<br><br>

                        I also had the fortune to look into and use various business relevant technologies like O365/M365, Entra, Intunes, PowerApps, electronic 
                        signature solutions, document management, long term archiving, identity management and many other tooling and technology. With constant learning 
                        I also stepped into more modern IT infrastructure over time - ranging from on-premise into cloud technology like Azure, OCI and AWS and 
                        I was also able to explore Containerization and Kubernetes, which is a fascinating area too.<br><br>

                        I am also involved in the open source community to follow Alan Kay's famous quote, "The best way to predict the future is to invent it.".
