                        Hi - my name is <b>Torsten Bergmann</b>.<br><br>I'm a Father, professional IT Architect and Coder, (Software) Engineer, Advisor, 
                        Hitchhiker and Geek - all in one person. My internet nickname since many years is <b>astares</b> - this is why you ended up here - 
                        on my domain with the same name. Overall I have accumulated 30 years of experience in IT - being fortunate that I earn a 
                        living doing what I love with topics that interest me by heart.<br><br>
                    
                        I was already keen on technology as a young boy - but being born in the eastern part of germany (in the former GDR) 
                        it was not easy to follow modern western technology. Especially not when the only computer in reach was a KC85/3 in a school cabinet.                   
                        Although thanks to my parents I enjoyed a careless childhood the corrupt socialist-communist system made it very clear to me in 
                        school already that only those who were allied with it had the opportunity to gain access to (eastern) technology. 
                        As members of our family already fled to the western part of germany (BRD) and also West Berlin I had to realize and understand 
                        that my parents, my brother and I were somehow trapped behind the iron wall. I was even told that the only chance of getting 
                        my hands on a computer later or joining one of the few technical universities was to enlist in the East German army (NVA) for 25 years. 

                        <br><br>
                        So in 1989 we fought for our rights with demonstrations on the streets and a peaceful revolution. The horrible wall broke 
                        down and a new era of FREEDOM and PEACE started allowing me to travel to different countries around the globe but also learning 
                        with and about modern technology.

                        My first computer was a Commodore 64 - initially controlled with my first BASIC programs, later also using Assembly 
                        Tater this home computer was accompanied by an Amiga 500.
