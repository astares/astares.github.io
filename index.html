                    <img src="/res/astares.png"><br><br>
                    <p align="left">
                        Hi - my name is <b>Torsten Bergmann</b>.<br><br>I'm a Father, professional IT Architect and Coder, (Software) Engineer, Advisor, 
                        Hitchhiker and Geek - all in one person. My internet nickname since many years is <b>astares</b> - this is why you ended up here - 
                        on my domain with the same name. Overall I have accumulated 30 years of experience in IT - being fortunate that I earn a 
                        living doing what I love with topics that interest me by heart.<br><br>
                    
                        I have a degree in computer science from the Technical University of Ilmenau with a focus on software engineering and telematics. 
                        My thesis researched into component-oriented software development (CORBA, COM/COM+ EJB, ...) and modular systems. In software development I am a big fan 
                        and supporter of the OOP approach, dynamic languages ​​and metadata-driven software technology, model driven development but also RAD tools.<br><br>

                        In addition to my professional career as a software developer, consultant, project manager, software architect and later also IT manager 
                        I had responsibility in IT operations and IT security for various business applications. I worked primarily in finance and insurance industry, but 
                        also logistics, transport and other.<br>
                        The opportunity to work in an international environment gave me valuable insights in how small local and large global acting companies work and how they differ.
                        But it also helped me to understand and drive how to move from small scale to more large scale. Be it in (distributed) teams, worldwide locations and 
                        their interactions but also in on-premise vs. hybrid vs. cloud based IT environments.
                        <br><br>

                        Being the lead on several business relevant applications I shaped software in close contact to users and partners according to the 
                        business needs. With strong internal teams and external support it was also possible to work on migrations for valuable legacy systems 
                        and move them to more modern technology stacks while keeping these systems fully operated for the end users.
                        Part of my work was also to guide and steer such teams and introduce them to proper government procedures in regulated environments 
                        and standardized processes like release and config management.<br><br>

                        I'm used to Windows OS (down to the API level) but also use many Linux derivates like Ubuntu and elementaryOS as well as iOS on Apple. 
                        Historically I even worked on platforms like OS/2 and Solaris Unix machinery. Over the years I learned many programming languages: Basic, Pascal/Delphi,
                        Module, Haskell/Gofer, C/C++, Java, Self, JavaScript and many others. But none of them fascinated me like Smalltalk - the mother of all Object Oriented 
                        Programming languages.<br><br>

                        I also had the fortune to look into and use various business relevant technologies like O365/M365, Entra, Intunes, PowerApps, electronic 
                        signature solutions, document management, long term archiving, identity management and many other tooling and technology. With constant learning 
                        I also stepped into more modern IT infrastructure over time - starting with on-premise and later into cloud technology like Azure, OCI and AWS with an incredible amount of computing flexibility. 
                        I was also able to explore Containerization and Kubernetes, which is a fascinating area too.<br><br>

                        Being part of the overall Smalltalk, dynamic-language lover and developer community I try to keep me up to date and curious 
                        for much better technologies compared to what is often status of the mainstream. I feel also honored to have met interesting and open-minded 
                        engineers and scientists there and to have a constant exchange with interesting people from all over the world.
                        
                        Appreciating such a gift on one side I also try to give something back on the other. Through my involvement in the open source community I 
                        try to follow Alan Kay's famous quote, "The best way to predict the future is to invent it.".

                    <p>"Write once run anywhere" (WORA) - the ability to run on different devices was already present in Smalltalk before the programming language Java popularized it. Over the years more and more computing power became available. As an IT guy I find it interesting to experiment with software on various platforms and devices (TV, smartphone, smartwatch). 
                        In this video you see me running Pharo on a custom done Raspberry Pi. I own several Pi machines and also use them to host headless server apps like "Swiki"

                    <p>As a developer you often have many windows open - typically you organize them on virtual desktop screens. While this is pretty standard on Linux desktop managers Pharo unfortunately did not have support for it. So I provided an implementation as a tool to the community based on World switching and Pharo 5 version. It also integrates nicely into spotter.</p>

                    <b>Astares UML Support for Pharo</b>
                    <p>instead of hardcoding it is often useful to keep (design) info inside of a model created with the help of the Unified Modelling Language (UML). The included meta information can be used to generate code for a target platform (following the classical approach) or keeping the meta-info available and changeable within the runtime.                    
                        <br><br>
                        Especially the latter approach is some fascinating way to automize application building to a high degree - even beyond what is today known as low-code platforms. I have many ideas in my head for that topic and for a few I already wrote some nice tools like an XMI importer and several model runtime platforms. The goal is to even 
                        bootstrap the metamodel from a model description. For me this is interesting private research as it also shifts away the focus from code reuse towards reusing model parts and components.

                    <b>Serve dynamic web content from Pharo using Tealight</b>
                    <p>
                        When I contributed to the amazing Teapot web framework I felt like something was missing. I wanted to increase the interactive nature and also have better support for the REST based approach. So I wrote <b>Tealight</b> which is a web framework on its own 
                        and allows for instance rapidly prototype but also dynamically implement an own service or webpage.
                        <br><br>
                        The Code for Tealight is available on my GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com/astares/Tealight">https://github.com/astares/Tealight</a> together with an extensive documentation.

                    <b>Pharo OS-xxx series support</b>
                    <p>
                        While Pharo is platform independent on one side it is often necessary to access native features of the underlying platform. While initially different approaches
                        for callouts/callbacks had been used (like FFI/Alien, then NativeBoost with assembler generation based on AsmJit) the Foreign Function interface has later been unified into UFFI and even allows 
                        threaded FFI (TFFI).

                        For better support on platforms like Windows, iOS and different Linux distros I wrote specific packages:

                    <b>Pharo OS-Linux-Ubuntu support</b>
                    <p>
                        While I work a lot on Windows I like and use Linux distros a lot for coding but also automation. Ubuntu is one of the few distros that provide many packages to their users. So why not spice it up with a more object oriented approach to allow for better and easy usage right from inside the Pharo lively environment.
